# Tags are used to group endpoints. There can be multiple tags per endpoint,
# the first tag determines the interface (in case of Java) defining this endpoint
# in the generated code.
tags:
  - name: Rooms

  - name: Messages
    description: Chat room messages management
  - name: Users
    description: Users management

# Components referenced from the endpoints. There are several groups
# of components - we are using parameters, responses and schemas here,
# but there are also others (securitySchemes, headers, links, ...)
components:
  # The actual definitions of parameters referenced below.
  # Note that we are describing their features here, but the actual
  # data type is being referenced further. This time we do it to reuse
  # the data types in other places. It is also good practice to have
  # them all defined in the schemas part of the components definition.
